# Face-Detection

## Overview  
This project implements **real-time face detection** using **OpenCVâ€™s Deep Neural Network (DNN) module** with a **pre-trained Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) model**. It captures video from a webcam, processes each frame, and detects faces with bounding boxes and confidence scores.  

## Features  
- Real-time face detection using a **deep learning model**  
- Bounding box with **confidence percentage**  
- Works on **CPU** (can be optimized for GPU)  
- Simple and efficient implementation  

## Installation  
Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed.You can install the dependencies using the following command:  
```
bash pip install opencv-python numpy
```
